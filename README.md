# MeanApp

Boiler plate to have a express JS REST API along with an Angular 4 front end able to be served up. 
Boiler plate comes with karma and protractor testing capabilities as well as angular cli use. 
In order to serve up the front end in any cloud environment, you should run ng build and push that code to the cloud with it configured to look at the index.html in the dist folder.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.
